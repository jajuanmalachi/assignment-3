<h2>Unemployment has been critical in recent time but how has that impacted recent Gen-Z college graduates?</h2>


<div>
	<p> Over the last two to three years, the prospect of finding gainful employment has become an increasingly challenging task. In fact, it has become arguably more difficult than ever before. Some of the factors that contribute to such adversity include the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that the nation is on the verge of a recession, and more qualified candidates in competition with new members of the job force for entry-level positions. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “the unemployment rate increased in 2020, surging to 13.0 percent in the second quarter of the year.” In addition to these unfavorable side effects, there are several logistical and technological facets that may be to blame as well. Some of these include high volume of applications, artificial intelligence vetting, smaller professional networks, misleading listings and much more. With all this being said, what does this mean for recent Gen-Z college graduates? Was all of their hard work in vain? Does it just make more sense to avoid the whims of corporate America altogether? Let’s check out the direct correlation between unemployment rates and college graduates below to place things into glaring perspective.  </p>

<div><p>"According to Michael Lazar of McKinsey & Company, Gen-Z is less finally secure: 45 percent are concerned about the stability of their employment (compared with 40 percent of all respondents) are less likely than other respondents to report being able to cover living expenses far more than two months if faced with job loss. Gen Z is also more likely to report that the pay they receive does not allow for a good quality of life.”
